Examples of the concepts from the course CC5114: Neural Networks 
and Genetic Programming

Packages are numbered in the order they were developed

## basic_perceptrons
---

This package contains basic implementations of perceptrons and 
networks made from them, along with a more specific collection of 
single perceptron logic gates and a bit adder network of nand gates

`basic_perceptrons.py` contains a perceptron implementation and 
all logic gate implementations, including some extra methods for 
use outside the package

`basic_networks.py` contains a basic yet extensible network 
implementation as well as the addition network

## learning_perceptrons
